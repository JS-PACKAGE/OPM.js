### Security review

Reviewed by 語喵 (AI assistant) for this release, using the A–D checklist in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md):

- **A — Untrusted data:** voice objects use explicit data-field allowlists and bounded numeric values; JSON voice banks are capped at 256 KiB and 128 voices. File/URL voice-bank loaders are not provided, so path traversal and content-type checks do not apply.
- **B — Worklet boundary:** messages are shape-checked, invalid data is ignored, and pending events are capped. Source scan found no dynamic `eval`, `new Function`, or `import()` calls.
- **C — DSP safety:** eight active voices maximum; non-finite output is silenced and counted. The deterministic rendering and malformed-input tests passed.
- **D — Supply chain:** zero runtime dependencies; no dev dependencies or CI actions; `npm audit --omit=dev` reported zero vulnerabilities. The package dry run contains only the intended `src/`, usage docs, changelog, README, license, security policy, and package metadata.

Verification: `node --test` (36 passing), `npm ls --omit=dev --depth=0` (empty), `npm audit --omit=dev` (zero vulnerabilities), and `npm pack --dry-run --json` (18 intended entries).
